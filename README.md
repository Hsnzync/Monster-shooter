## Getting Started

### Motivation

This project started as a school project that didn't felt "finished". For that reason, the game was further developed so that it was playable and challenging for the player.

The game has been expanded with a start screen, introduction screen and the main game. This makes it feel like a full-fledged game.

### Inspiration

Since childhood I have a soft spot for retro games, especially fast RPG style games. With beautiful music in the background, these games finished it off. I have brought back these kinds of aspects in "Monster Shooter", so that the player gets this feeling back as much as possible.

## Installation
